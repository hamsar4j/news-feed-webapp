# News Feed Webapp

This repo contains the codebase for a news feed web application, where users are able to create, update, fetch, and display news articles. The frontend is developed using TypeScript and React, with Chakra UI providing a clean and modern interface. Axios is used as the API library for making HTTP requests to the backend. The backend utilizes an Express server and an SQLite database to handle user interactions and data storage.

## Steps to run app

At the root of the project

- `npm install` to install required dependencies
- `npm run server` to run the server for the sqlite db in one terminal instance
- `npm start` to run the app in second terminal instance
